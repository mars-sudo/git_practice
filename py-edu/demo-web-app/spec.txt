# When beginning a project, you first neeed to descript the project in a specification, or spec. 
# Then you'll set up a virtual environment in which to build the project. 
# Here's the spec.

We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they're
interested in and to make journal enteries as they learn about each topic. 
The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to either register
or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read
and edit existing entries. 

# To work with Django, you first need to set up a virtual environment. 
# A virtual envrionment is a place on your system where yoyu can install packages 
# and isolate them from all other Python packages. This will be beneficial When
# we deploy the Learning Log program to a server. 

# Create a new diretory called learning_log, switch to that directory in
# terminal or powershell. Type 

python -m venv ll_env 

# Then Type
cd ll_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 
# This will actvate the virtual environment
# Type
deativate
# To leave the virtual environment
