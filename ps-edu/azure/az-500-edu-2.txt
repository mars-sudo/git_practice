Security Virtual Networks
Default system routes allow: 
Internet connectivity - Using the 0.0.0.0/0 prefix, there is a default rout to the internet.
Virtual Network connectivity - Traffic is automatically routed b/t subnets using all specifid address ranges.
 Service-Specific Connectivity - Configuring some services results in route configuration (ex. VNet peering or ExpressRoute)

Custom routes:
Allow changes to the default routing behavior. For example - Blocking internet access (Using the none next hop type, 
we can block internet access) or Forcing Traffic via Another Address (Using various next hop types, we can enforce traffic elsewhere
for example via Azure Firewall or via an on-premises router using forced tunneling.)

Special scenarios and configuration:
Automatic System Routes - System routes can be automatically generated (ex. VNet Peering or service endpoints)
System Routs and BGP - It is possible to use border gateway protocol (BGP) to help manage dynamic routing (ExpressRoute or VPN)
Route Priority - When multiple routes contain the same address prefix, the following is used: Custom > BGP > System

Azure Firewall 
Deployment Overview
1. Configure a Virtual Network - This can be an existing VNet, but is often a centralied VNet connected to your other VNets.
2. Configure a Subnet - Azure Firewall must be deployed to a dedicated subnet called AzureFirewallSubnet. NSGs are disabled for this subnet.
3. Configure Routing - In order to have VNet resources leverate Azure Firewall, a custom route must direct traffic to Azure Firewall.

Configuration Overview
Network Rules - Similar to NSGs, but focues on outbout filtering. These rules are processed before application rules.
Application Rules - Application rules allow outbound security to be defined with the use of a FQDN.
NAT Rules - With an NAT rule, we can configure inbound (DNAT) rules. Currently, outbound (SNAT) is managaed by Microsoft using all public IPs.

Azure Firewall Manager
Centralized management interface for Azure Firewall features and resources.

Centralized Policies - Centrally manage the configuration of Azure Azure firewalls  
Secure Virtual Networks - Manage Azure Firewall for virtual Networks
Seucre Virtual Hub - Manage Azure Firewall for Azure Virtual WAN

Securing Integrated Networks and Services
VNet Peering - Designed for VNet-to-VNet connectivity, supports cross-subscription, cross-region, corss-Azure AD tenant,
                Leverages the Microsoft Backbone for private IT address connectivity, Typically used for private, low-latency 
                interconnectiity. 

VPN - Designed for hypbrid connectivity (site-to-site, point-to-site), Supports similar VNet connectivity (cross-sub, cross-region),
        Requires a public IP address to be used for connectivity, Generally used where encryption and/or transitive routing is needed. 

ExpressRoute 
ExpressRoute Circuit - The connectivity into Microsoft global infrastructure, which leverages both Microsft and partner edge networking.
Peering - Private or Microsoft peering facilitates a secure connection to virtual networks or Microsoft 365, respectively.
ExpressRoute Gateway - AVNet Gateway of ExpressRoute type. Must exist in a gateway subnet. SKU determines features, bandwidth, etc.
