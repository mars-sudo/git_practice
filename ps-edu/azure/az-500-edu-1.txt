Cloud Authenticaiton

Password Hash Sync (PHS)
    # Lowest effor of the three Azure AD Connect authenticatio nmethods
    # Requires the least infrastructre of teh three options (sychronization only).
    # Sycrhonizes a hash (of a hash) of user passwords.
    # Doesn't immediatley enforce changes in on-premises account states
    # Only supports Disabled Account, but not password expiry or account lockout. 

Pass-through Authentication (PTA)
    # Medium effort between the three Auzre AD Connect authenticaiton methods. 
    # Requires sychronization and authentication infrastructure.
    # USes an outbound network tunnet to support authenticaiton from on-prem. 
    # Enforces the on-premises account policies at the time of sign-in.
    # Supports additional account states (disabled, lockout, expiry, restricted).

Active Driectory Federation Services (ADFS)
    # Most complex of the three Azure AD Connect authentication methods.
    # Requires synchrnization, ADFS, and web app proxy infrastructure.
    # Requires inbound network connectivity as authenticaiton is handled on-prem.
    # Supports advances scenarios (e.g., smart card auth, third-party MFA, etc).

Azure AD External Identities

Azure AD B2B
# Guest Access - Azure AD B2B allows external users to be invited as guests, providing seamless, licenses access to resources

# B2C Tenant - Idenitty information is stored with a dedicated B2C tenant (not within the customer's exisiting Azure AD tenant).
# External Identitites - MAny different social identitites are available, as well as SAML and WS-Fed-based identity provider federation.
